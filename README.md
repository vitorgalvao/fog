### Project Status

The app is considered complete. It fulfils its goal and has (to my knowledge) been stable and bug-free for several years. On Apple Silicon Macs, it is deprecated in favour of the iOS Overcast app. On Intel Macs it should continue to work for the foreseeable future. The repository is archived to denote that breaks due to external forces (such as Electron bugs or Overcast site changes) won’t be proactively addressed.

## Install

[Download the latest version](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/fog/releases).

## Development

Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

##### Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run: `npm start`
- Build for macOS: `npm run build-macos`
- Build for all platforms: `npm run build`
- Build for macOS and package as a zip: `npm run package-macos`
- Build for all platforms and package as a zip: `npm run package`

Currently, only macOS is supported. I do not intend to officially support other platforms in the near future since I cannot consistently and reliably test on them, but am willing to add support if someone wants to collaborate in doing the legwork.
